      <description>ABSTRACT In this paper, a hardware design based on the field programmable gate array (FPGA) to implement a linear regression algorithm is presented. The arithmetic operations were optimized by applying a fixed-point number representation for all hardware based computations. A floating-point number training data point was initially created and stored in a personal computer (PC) which was then converted to fixed-point representation and transmitted to the FPGA via a serial communication link.</description>
